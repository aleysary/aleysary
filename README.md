## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
## Welcome to my Github Portfolio 
###### Iâ€™m Aley Sary, a Computer Science major at Frostburg State University. Iâ€™m passionate about technology, problem-solving, and creating things that make a difference or just for fun. Whether itâ€™s building apps, designing websites, or diving into challenging coding projects, I enjoy exploring new ideas and pushing myself to learn and grow.
###### Iâ€™ve worked with a variety of tools and languages. While many of my projects are private, my public repositories give a glimpse into the diverse work I enjoy
